    "Now that you've gained some practical experience, it's time to revisit the theoretical aspect and delve into the world of data types. While data types may not be at the forefront of many Python code projects, they play a crucial role in how data is manipulated. In Python, numbers behave as expected, strings serve their purpose, Booleans determine truth or falsehood, and beyond that, you have the freedom to create your own objects and collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when it comes to NumPy, the story becomes more intricate. NumPy employs C code beneath its surface to optimize performance, and this optimization hinges on a critical requirement: all elements within an array must share the same data type. It's not merely about them being the same Python type; they must possess identical underlying C types, along with matching shapes and sizes in terms of bits!\n",
    "\n",
    "Python, by default, defines only one type for each data class, such as a single integer type and a single floating-point type. This simplicity can be advantageous in applications where you don't need to concern yourself with the various ways data can be represented within a computer. However, in the realm of scientific computing, greater control is often necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NumPy, you'll encounter 24 new fundamental Python types designed to describe various scalar data types. These type descriptors draw heavily from the types available in the C language, which CPython, the Python interpreter, is written in. Additionally, NumPy introduces several extra types that align with Python's native types, providing you with a rich palette of options for precise data manipulation in scientific computing endeavors."

Each field within this structure is given a name, providing a convenient means of access. The parent data type, within which these fields reside, must possess adequate size to accommodate all its constituent fields. Typically, the parent data type is based on the versatile void type, capable of accommodating items of arbitrary sizes. It's worth noting that structured data types can also include nested sub-array data types within their fields.\n",
