# Tech Stocks vs. Silicon: Decoding the Complexities of Market Dynamics

## Project Overview

In the heart of the tech industry, where innovation meets economics, we embark on a mission to decipher the intricate relationships between the stock prices of leading technology companies and the fluctuating price of silicon, the cornerstone of modern technology. Our journey spans from the iconic "AAPL" to the influential "ORCL", navigating through the conversion of silicon prices from dollars to euros and vice versa. Adding a new layer to our investigation, we integrate metal prices into our analysis to explore potential correlations and influence on both silicon and tech stock prices.

## Methodology

Armed with Python, pandas, and the aesthetic power of seaborn, we gather historical stock data for a curated list of tech behemoths. We visualize their closing prices over time, searching for trends or anomalies that may hint at a connection with silicon prices. To enrich our analysis, we delve into the dynamics of silicon pricing, presenting both dollar and euro price charts alongside their tech stock counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce metal prices into our framework, aiming to uncover any underlying patterns or influences on silicon and tech stock prices.

## The Results

Utilizing a variety of machine learning models, including deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), we incorporate the metal prices feature into our analysis. Despite the complexity and depth of our models, the results reveal a nuanced picture: no significant correlation emerges between tech stocks and silicon prices, nor does the introduction of metal prices simplify the relationship. The intricate dance between these elements remains as elusive as ever, suggesting that the interplay of factors influencing silicon prices and tech stock prices is multifaceted and complex.

## Conclusion

Our endeavor to uncover a harmonious relationship between tech stocks and silicon prices, enriched by the inclusion of metal prices, concludes with a nuanced understanding of the market dynamics. The absence of a clear, direct correlation underscores the complexity of financial markets and the challenges in isolating causal relationships among seemingly interconnected variables. As we continue to dissect the vast landscape of technological and economic indicators, the quest for a definitive link between these elements persists, offering a rich tapestry of possibilities for future exploration.
