# Tech Stocks vs. Silicon: A Silicon Valley Saga

## Project Synopsis

Venturing into the bustling world of Silicon Valley, we set out on a digital treasure hunt to unravel the mysterious ties between the stock market gyrations of tech titans and the volatile price swings of silicon, the lifeblood of the tech industry. From the grandeur of Apple's "AAPL" to Oracle's "ORCL," we navigate through the labyrinth of silicon prices, converting them from USD to EUR and back again, all while keeping an eye on the precious metals market to see if they're playing a secret role in this dance.

## Our Approach

Equipped with Python, pandas, and the visual wizardry of seaborn, we embark on a data safari, collecting historical stock data from a select group of tech giants. We plot their closing prices over time, like detectives looking for clues that might connect them to silicon prices. To add another layer to our detective work, we also dive into the world of silicon pricing, displaying charts in both USD and EUR formats, and throw in metal prices for good measure, hoping to uncover hidden patterns that might influence silicon and tech stock prices.

## What We Found

After dusting off our machine learning models, including the likes of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and incorporating metal prices into our analysis, we were left with a puzzling outcome: no clear link could be drawn between tech stocks and silicon prices, even with the addition of metal prices. It seems the relationship between these elements is as enigmatic as trying to explain quantum physics to a cat.

## Final Thoughts

Our quest to find a straightforward relationship between tech stocks and silicon prices, enhanced by the inclusion of metal prices, ended up revealing just how complicated the financial markets can be. The lack of a simple, direct correlation highlights the intricate web of factors that influence silicon prices and tech stock prices, reminding us that sometimes, the answers aren't as straightforward as they seem. As we continue to peel back layers of this complex onion, the search for a definitive connection between these elements remains a captivating mystery, ripe for further exploration.
