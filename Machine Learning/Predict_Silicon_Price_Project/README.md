# Tech Stocks vs. Silicon: The Unlikely Love Story That Wasn't

## Project Overview

In the world of tech, where every pixel counts, we embarked on a quest to unravel the hidden connections between the stock prices of some of the biggest names in technology and the price of silicon, the very foundation of our digital age. With tickers ranging from Apple's "AAPL" to Oracle's "ORCL," and silicon prices converted from dollars to euros and back, we set sail on a journey filled with data, plots, and a whole lot of speculation. Now, adding another layer to our investigation, we've included metal prices to further explore potential correlations.

## Methodology

Equipped with Python, pandas, and a dash of seaborn for style, we downloaded historical stock data for a select group of tech giants. We then plotted their closing prices against time, hoping to spot any trends or anomalies that might hint at a connection with silicon prices. To broaden our scope, we also dove deep into silicon pricing, converting dollar prices to euros and plotting them side by side with their dollar counterparts. Furthermore, we introduced metal prices into our analysis, aiming to uncover any underlying patterns or influences on both silicon and tech stock prices.

## The Results

After meticulously analyzing the data with a variety of machine learning models, including the newly added metal prices feature, we discovered... drumroll, please... still no significant correlation, no discernible trend, just a complex interplay of factors influencing silicon prices and tech stock prices. It appears that the intricate dance between tech stocks and silicon prices remains as elusive as ever, with metal prices adding another dimension to the puzzle without revealing a clear pattern.

## Conclusion

Despite the allure of uncovering a harmonious relationship between tech stocks and silicon prices, our findings suggest that such a connection remains as elusive as ever. The introduction of metal prices into our analysis adds complexity but does not simplify the task of finding a direct correlation. As we continue to explore the vast landscape of technological and economic indicators, perhaps we will stumble upon a revelation that ties them together more convincingly. Until then, the quest for understanding the intricate web of tech stock prices and raw material costs continues, offering endless opportunities for exploration and discovery.

## Acknowledgments

A heartfelt thank you to all the tech titans whose stock prices we analyzed, and to the metals industry for providing yet another piece of the puzzle. Your fluctuations continue to fuel our curiosity, pushing us to delve deeper into the mysteries of market dynamics.

## Note

This analysis, while engaging and informative, serves primarily as a thought experiment. For those seeking investment advice, professional insights remain the gold standard. Let this project serve as a reminder of the complexities inherent in financial markets and the importance of rigorous analysis.
